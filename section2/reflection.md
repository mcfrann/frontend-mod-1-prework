## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

    The blog posts were very illuminating in both knowing when to ask questions and knowing
    that seemingly silly questions in the beginning are okay too; what may seem obvious
    later on doesn't mean it's obvious now and we need to ask these questions to get to that
    point of being able to look back with more clarity. I've been exercising my vulnerability
    in asking questions in Slack and the more I ask questions, the more comfortable it becomes.
    I try to do everything I can to figure out a problem on my own for about 20 minutes,
    like some of the blog posts suggest, but that happens to be around the time I start getting
    frustrated, so it's a great time to take a little break and ask for help. If anything,
    I could probably get more comfortable asking questions before I reach levels of frustration.

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

    It felt good to reinforce some of the knowledge and tactics we learned in Section 1
    and put it all into practice. Having to type out the node commands really clarified
    for me where to run them from in my directories and allowed me to actually help
    another student in Slack having issues with this, implementing a SuperLearner strategy
    in teaching another what I've learned! The discomfort came when learning about functions
    because I feel like I've still only scratched the surface, but I'm excited to continue
    exploring outside resources.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

    A conditional statement is a statement that can be evaluated as true or false
    that an `if` statement can then be applied to.
    An example of this would be "If I have less than 1000 dollars, then I can't pay rent."
    An application that probably uses a conditional is Instagram: "If you don't follow this user && their feed is private, then you can't see their feed."

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

    You add "else if" for multiple conditions in an `if` statement. In my own words, the program then can read them like
    "If scenario 1 happens, then this happens OR if scenario 2 happens, then this happens, OR if scenario 3 happens, then this happens,
    otherwise, this happens."

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

    Logical operators are available to check conditions. If you want to check if two conditions are met, you can include `&&` in your code block.
    If you want to check if one of two conditions is met, you can include `||`.

6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

    In the second to last problem in if-statements.js the instructions later say that I may have had to use a logical operator for it,
    however I'm not sure why I would have needed to use one in that question because it was just checking one condition.
