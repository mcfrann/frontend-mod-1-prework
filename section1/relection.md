## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

    This article resonated with me because they are habits I've had first hand experience
    with in helping me to not only absorb, but retain important information in my
    learning history. I already consider myself an avid reader, but where I need work
    is in the mentality side of these habits; viewing learning as an ongoing process
    and adopting a growth mindset. I feel like both of these outlooks relieve a lot
    of pressure on the learning process. The other thing I'm excited to implement is
    taking plenty of breaks because this is something that I feel will contribute to my
    overall endurance in learning. I can't think of anything not on the list, but I'm sure that
    as my journey at Turing progresses, I will develop a lot of new habits that work the best
    for me in becoming a SuperLearner!

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

    Numeric data types are values that have numeric value, including negative numbers and decimals.
    (5432 6.75 -0.65)

    String data types are values within quotes that are a line of text including numbers and
    other characters.
    ("Hello, how are you?" 'I have 23 cats!')

    Boolean data types are values that answer true or false.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

    console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

    After two forward slashes or text between a forward slash and asterisk

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

    A variable is data that we determine, but that we can also change later on.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

    Although I'm trying to limit my use of this app, I used Instagram a lot. Examples of three
    variables Instagram uses are:

    var likeQuantity; (This would be a numeric data type)
    var followingUser; (This would be a Boolean data type)
    var caption; (This would be a string data type)

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

    Concatenation is the joining together of variables within a string.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

    Again, Instagram uses concatenation in examples phrases like "View all 243 comments" and
    "ldfl and 34 others liked your photo"

    console.log("View all " + commentQuantity + " comments");

    console.log(userName + " and " + likeQuantity " liked your photo");


9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

    When you choose to write out interpolation like this, is it the only exception to needing
    a semicolon at the end? I noticed in the Mod 1 Prework section on this that it didn't include a
    semicolon:

    var snackCount = `I have ${quantity} ${snacks}!`
