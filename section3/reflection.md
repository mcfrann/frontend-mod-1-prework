## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- Two points that resonated for me from the Growth Mindset blog series were viewing asking for help
as a strength and being open to feedback from fellow developers. Learning to ask for
help has been something I've had to get more and more comfortable with since Mod 0 started,
and I'm happy to see the outcome of strengthening that muscle. I've connected with my professors
and peers along with deepening my understanding of certain elements or where I went wrong in a line of code.
Asking questions was something I've always felt timid about, and now I can see that the
payoff is so much greater than the apprehension. I'm also really excited to start
receiving feedback from other developers. At this point, I feel really eager to implement
a Growth Mindset to just learn as much as I can, realizing that the journey will never be over!

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- I've become very comfortable asking questions both in Slack and in class, which was a process
and I'm very proud of myself for! I think one element I will definitely need more work in is
realizing that there is always room for growth. I have perfectionistic tendencies, so implementing
this aspect of a Growth Mindset I believe will be extremely beneficial in not only my programming
journey, but in all areas of my life!

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
