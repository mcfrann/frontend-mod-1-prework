## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- Two points that resonated for me from the Growth Mindset blog series were viewing asking for help
as a strength and being open to feedback from fellow developers. Learning to ask for
help has been something I've had to get more and more comfortable with since Mod 0 started,
and I'm happy to see the outcome of strengthening that muscle. I've connected with my professors
and peers along with deepening my understanding of certain elements or where I went wrong in a line of code.
Asking questions was something I've always felt timid about, and now I can see that the
payoff is so much greater than the apprehension. I'm also really excited to start
receiving feedback from other developers. At this point, I feel really eager to implement
a Growth Mindset to just learn as much as I can, realizing that the journey will never be over!

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- I've become very comfortable asking questions both in Slack and in class, which was a process
and I'm very proud of myself for! I think one element I will definitely need more work in is
realizing that there is always room for growth. I have perfectionistic tendencies, so implementing
this aspect of a Growth Mindset I believe will be extremely beneficial in not only my programming
journey, but in all areas of my life!

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
- Instagram definitely uses arrays in lists of users, followers, likes, and photos.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
- An array is a list of data; items within the array can be various data types such as strings, numbers, or booleans.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
- The purpose of a loop is to repeat code for an `n` number of times as long as the condition returns as true.
We could use a loop with an array if we want to run code for each item in the array vs. if we just
want to run it on its own based off of the condition we set using numbers.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
- A loop is when you repeat a certain action for as long as something we determine is true.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
- I guess I am a little unclear on what a loop does or what the use of it is on its own without being applied to an array.
