-pop() - this removes the last item in an array and returns that item. This obviously
changes the length of the array as well.

-shift() - removes the first item from an array and returns the removed item.

-push() - adds one or more item to the end of the array, and can return the new length.

-unshift() - adds one or more item to the beginning of an array and returns new length.
