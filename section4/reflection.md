## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
    The workflow definitely felt super different, it was good to make sure I was intentional
    about taking plenty of breaks. Scheduled breaks help a lot to make sure I'm not working past the point of frustration
    and definitely helped a lot when learning about classes in this section.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
    I actually found that once I met my expectation for the day, I reached it sooner than I thought and decided to proceed after
    I took a longer break than my others. I was really not distracted so I got my work done a lot quicker than I thought!

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
    An Array is just a specific type of Object. An object is made up of the Object Literal, or properties with values assigned to them
    that all contribute to the Object's different defining characteristics.

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
      Array - students are just one property of class we can store in one variable
  * List of states and their capitals
      Object - a little more difficult to store in one variable as capitals are properties of that state
  * List of things to pack for vacation
      Array - this list can be stored in one variable because it's one property
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
      Array - would make sense to be stored in one variable since it's just one property (people I follow)
  * List of student names and their cohort
      Object - since there are properties for the student (their cohort) this would be
      better for an object
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
      Object - since there are multiple properties that represent one thing (the cake)
      an object makes more sense
  * All my favorite restaurants
      Array - just a simple list with no other properties

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
    Spotify could be an example of an app using Objects. An example of an Object could be a playlist, the keys being number of songs(numberSongs), total
    time of playlist (totalPlayTime), most popular genre (avgGenre), etc.

6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
    "Is there a way to add/subtract/update a key(or multiple keys) from an object without typing the whole code again?
